# aou_submission

Welcome to UCSD's approach to submitting data to the All of Us project.  

## Data Safety / Build Directory

*** BE CAREFUL WITH GIT ***

This is a git project.  It's super easy to inadvertantly check in sensitive information.  Be careful not to do
this.  Do not check in PII, PHI, HIPAA, CaBOR, or other protected data.  

## RE-READ THIS ^^^

It's extremely important. 

## READMEs

Each README either describe some intricate issue or chronicle some important evolution in the submission process.

*** PLEASE DO NOT SKIP THE READMEs. ***


## Modularization and Robustness

This submission process is broken into several scripts.  Each script is modular.  This is meant
to provide some modularization.  It's easier to diagnose issues that a monolithic approach.

## Organization

The source code is broken out by letter... A, B, C, D, E.  Each letter has a number of python
scripts inside marked 1, 2, 3, 4.  These are meant to be executed in order.
